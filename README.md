# Project Title: Megaline Mobile Plan Recommendation Model

Overview:
Welcome to the Megaline Mobile Plan Recommendation Model project! This GitHub repository contains the code and resources to develop a model that analyzes subscriber behavior and recommends one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. The primary goal of this project is to create a model with an accuracy of at least 0.75 on the test dataset.

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately recommend one of Megaline's plans (Smart or Ultra) based on subscribers' behavior.

Contents:

data: This directory holds the datasets used for analysis.

users_behavior.csv: Dataset containing subscribers' behavior data, including usage details and plan information.
notebooks: This directory includes Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and visualization.

Megaline Machine Learning.ipynb: Notebook detailing the data cleaning and preprocessing steps. Notebook containing the process of developing the recommendation model. Notebook for evaluating the model's accuracy. Notebook showcasing visualizations of the analysis results. This directory contains visual assets generated during the analysis.

README.md: The main documentation file for the project, providing a summary, objectives, and instructions for replicating the analysis.

Project Workflow:

Data Preprocessing:

Loaded and cleaned the subscribers' behavior dataset.
Handled missing values, data types, and formatting.

Model Development:

Developed a predictive model using machine learning algorithms.
Trained the model using the training dataset.

Evaluation:

Evaluated the model's accuracy using the test dataset.
Checked if the accuracy meets the minimum threshold of 0.75.

Visualization:

Created visualizations to illustrate the model's accuracy distribution.
Generated charts and graphs to showcase the evaluation results.
